# Tutorial: Results Analysis

Grex returns raw results. Rules can overlap and be sub-rules matching subsets of others. The postprocessing filters are under development (WIP ðŸš§)

Rules capture strong correlations between the features in the sample space of the scope and the conclusion. Rules could be:

- pertinent linguistic patterns
- corpus properties
- irrelevant patterns

The results are encoded in a JSON file. This file contains information on the scope and conclusion, the given file path, the intercept values for each model, and the predicted patterns.

Grex returns patterns for

- **positive rules**: patterns that favor the conclusion
- **negative rules**: patterns that support the negation (Â¬) of the conclusion

At the top of the file, you will find some general information about the extraction.

- **s_occs**: number of occurrences matched by the scope.
- **q_occs**: number of occurrences matched by the scope and the conclusion.

Each pattern is associated with a series of information and statistics to interpret the model's decision.

- **p_occs**: number of matches of the selected pattern within the scope.
- **pq_occs**: number of occurrences matching the pattern p and the conclusion within the scope.
- **decision**: indicator of a positive or negative rule
- **coverage**: The proportion of occurrences matching the conclusion that are captured by the pattern P, within the scope.
- **precision**: the proportion of occurrences matched by the pattern that actually match also the conclusion, whithin the scope.
- **delta**: the difference in frequency between occurrences matching the pattern and conclusion, and the expected frequency under the independence hypothesis.

Some information from statistical inference:

- **g-statistic**: value of the g-statistic
- **p-value**: the probability of observing the value of the g-statistic or a more extreme value under the independence hypothesis (Note that if sample is too large, it becomes uninformative.)
- **cramers_phi**: effect size measure

And some information regarding the model and the ranking:

- **alpha**: the value of the penalty parameter when the function is activated. The partial order given by the alpha values can be interpreted as a salient order.
- **coef**: weight assigned to the feature
