# Tutorial

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to grammar extraction using Grex, from the theoretical foundations to its practical application.

First, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the methodology, covering its scope and limitations. Then, we will offer a practical guide to the tool's capabilities and implementation.

The following key topics will be covered in order:

- **Fundamentals**: What treebanks are (the required data), the concept of a grammar rule and its formal definition.

- **Rule extraction definition**: How to operationalise the extraction of grammar rules using Grex through a YAML file

- **Feature space**: How to define the feature space which may be possible predictors or triggers of a rule.

- **Running Grex**: How to execute the extraction process.

- **Interpreting results**: How to understand and analyse the Grex's output.
