# Grex: Automatic Grammar Extraction

Grex is a tool for automatic grammar rule extraction from treebanks using machine learning.

It was created by Santiago Herrera, Caio Corro and Sylvain Kahane. A full description of the method can be found in the paper (the code deprecated): https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17534

The maintained code is [here](https://github.com/FilippoC/grex2).
