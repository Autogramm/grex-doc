# **Grex**: Automatic **Gr**ammar **Ex**traction

Grex is a tool for automatic grammar rule extraction from treebanks using machine learning.

It was conceived by Santiago Herrera, Caio Corro, Bruno Guillaume and Sylvain Kahane. A full description of the method can be found in the paper (the code is deprecated): https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17534

The maintained code is [here](https://github.com/Autogramm/grex).
